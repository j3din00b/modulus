# Normalize Transform Configuration
# Normalizes specified fields using mean-std or min-max scaling
#
# Method options:
#   - mean_std: Applies (x - mean) / std
#   - min_max: Applies (x - center) / half_range, normalizing to [-1, 1]
_target_: physicsnemo.datapipes.transforms.Normalize
_convert_: all

# For min_max method, use these instead of means/stds:
